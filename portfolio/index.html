                    <p>Surface interactions play a critical role in determining the likelihood and strength of adhesion between two materials. The interactions are determined by the attractive forces (i.e. chemical interactions) that promote adhesion and the area of contact (i.e. surface area). Consequently, the surface chemistry and texture of a repellent material must be precisely controlled to minimize the adhesion of undesirable foulants.</p>
